# this is a simple reactjs project, serving as a basic knowledge of working with the javascript library/framework, conected to laravel's RESTFUL API.
the first folder is the laravel script. 
>> php artisan serve
the second folder is the reactjs frontend script
>> npm start
this is just a building block to greater projects and will love to work with greater minds and brains
